# OVERVIEW
These two functions are inspired by quake's Fast Inverse sqrt algorithms, giving us a good enough aproximation of the actual sqrt. The double version should have a significantly larger throughput than most other implementations of the sqrt function out there (except probably the hardware implemented ones...).

The mathematical explenation will not be given, but if you're intrested to know how I derived to these magic numbers for example, you can either ask me directly or request to add it in the README.md file
